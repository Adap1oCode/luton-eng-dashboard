# Running Vercel Builds Locally

This guide explains how to **replicate Vercel’s production build locally**, so you can catch the same errors you’d see when deploying to Vercel Cloud.  

---

## 1. Install the Vercel CLI
You only need to do this once. It gives you the same tools Vercel Cloud uses.

```bash
npm install -g vercel
Check it works:

bash
Copy code
vercel --version
2. Local Development (normal mode)
For day-to-day coding with hot reload:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
⚠️ This does not match Vercel’s production build. It’s just dev mode.

3. Run the Production Build Locally
This command simulates exactly what Vercel Cloud does when deploying:

bash
Copy code
vercel build
Runs next build with the same process Vercel uses.

Outputs results into a .vercel/output folder.

Any build errors here are the same ones Vercel Cloud would show.

4. Preview the Production Build Locally
Once built, serve it locally:

bash
Copy code
vercel dev --prebuilt
Uses the .vercel/output build (so it won’t rebuild).

Runs the app exactly as Vercel would serve it.

Lets you test deployment issues before pushing code.

5. No Need for the Main Account
You do not need my Vercel login.

These commands work offline.

No API tokens are required.

You’ll see the same errors I’d see in the cloud, but locally.

✅ Quick Summary
npm run dev → hot-reload development server

vercel build → replicate Vercel’s production build

vercel dev --prebuilt → preview the production build locally
